Analysis of Amazon reviews

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to see if Amazon paid "Vine" reviewers are biased toward favorable reviews vs a reviewer that just does it for the love of the game.

## Results

The three questions that are being analyzed are as follows:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

A majority of the reviews from the furniture dataset were non-Vine reviews - there were almost 18K non-Vine reviews vs only 136 Vine reviews.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Seventy-four Vine reviews were 5 stars vs 8480 Non-Vine reviews being 5 stars.

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

54% of the Vine reviews were positive, vs 47% of the Non-Vine reviews being 5 stars. This at least suggests some bias in the Vine reviews being more likely to be 5 stars. 

## Summary

There is likely bias in the Vine reviews because Vine reviews have a higher % of 5 star reviews vs the non-paid reviewers.

A good additional analysis would be a statistical test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the Vine reviewers and Non-vine reviews.
